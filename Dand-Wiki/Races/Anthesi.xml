      <p class="flavor">A long abandoned grave lies in rest near a now overgrown farmhouse. A small tree sprouts from behind the gravestone, its roots reaching deep into the earth below. The ground shifts for the first time in decades, as a small, green hand breaches the surface.</p>
      <h4>Physical Description</h4>
      <p>Anthesi are beings that resemble humanoids with plant or fungus-like characteristics, such as green or brown-tinted skin, vine like hair, and leaves, flowers, buds, or mushrooms growing across their bodies. Beneath the skin of an Anthesi head is the skull of a long dead humanoid being, from which they inherit small amounts of memories and knowledge from the owners previous life, as well as their general facial features. Though they continue to grow throughout most of their lives, their heads remain almost the same size throughout their lives, leaving the exceptionally young or old Anthesi with strange proportions. Their eyes contain large, black pupils and irises surrounded by pastel colored sclera, and older Anthesi display bioluminescent patterns of similar colors along their bodies.</p>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>Anthesi are created when the skull of a dead humanoid is overtaken with plant life, and magically animated. They may be the result of a necromancer's experiments, a powerful druid's magic, or wild magic leaking into an environment.</p>
      <h4>Anthesi Names</h4>
      <p>Anthesi do not have their own naming conventions, instead taking on the name of their skull's former owner, or simply accepting any name they are given by others.</p>
      <h4>Anthesi Traits</h4>
